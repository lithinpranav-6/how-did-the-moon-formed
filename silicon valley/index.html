<h1>how did the moon formed</h1>
    <p>formation the earth plays a significant
role in its birth
yes
in its 4.5 billion years of lifespan
planet earth has seen several asteroids
shooting towards it with great force
some of them collided with the earth and
got destroyed
while many of them hit the surface
creating bowl-shaped depressions called
craters
and most of them missed the hit and kept
flying ahead in space
though most traces of the earth's past
have long since been destroyed
but we can find clues for most of it and
that's why scientists have come up with
different theories about space formation
including the formation of the moon so
let us have a look at them one after the
other
although there are various theories
revolving around the formation of the
moon the following few are the most
concrete and popular ones
starting with the capture theory
according to this theory the moon was
formed elsewhere in the solar system and
was wandering in space aimlessly
unaware of its future
but when it came closer to our earth it
was captured by its gravity and since it
is still stuck in the gravitational
field of our planet
the next popular theory is called the
aggression theory
this theory suggests that the moon was
created along with the earth during its
formation
but this notion died out quickly as it
could not define the speed of the moon
another popular theory is called the
fission scenario
according to this theory the earth was
spinning so fast around its axes that a
small part of it broke away and began
revolving around the planet
but again
we didn't have much evidence to prove
this idea
and soon we came up with the most
concrete and widely accepted theory
which is the giant impact theory.
yes according to the giant impact theory
millions of years ago
even before the earth and the moon there
existed proto-earth and thea
a planet almost the size of mars
one day where these two bodies collided
with each other and due to the explosion
of heat the proto-earth and thea
melted only to form as a new giant body
that we today known as the planet earth
only the small part of the two planets
collected near the earth's orbit
which with time formed into the moon
that revolves around our planet.
did you know the size of our moon is
almost equivalent to that of the size of
the planet mars
also you won't believe it but the moon's
surface is actually dark</p>
